# WIFI-indoorPositioning
A python and IOT-based approach to indoor positioning using WIFI signals captured in a building. 
The UJIIndoorLoc Data Set is used for the analysis and development of the python script. I used a combination of different models including KNN, SVM and Random Forest. 
The main-hardware equipment used for the project was the ESP8266 WIFI chip that was used to capture data signals from building access points and store the data in a database.
